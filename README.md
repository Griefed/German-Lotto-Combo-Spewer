# German Lotto Combo Spewer

Fun project to generate lotto number combinations which haven't been drawn before.
Source for the list of previously drawn numbers is: https://www.lottozahlenonline.de/statistik/beide-spieltage/lottozahlen-auflistung.php

This is just a for-the-heck-of-it project. Using this will not increase your chances of
winning the lottery.

Requires Java 21.

Run like this to generate a single new combo:

`java -jar .\lotto-combo-spewer-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar`

Or if you want to generate multiple combinations:

`java -jar .\lotto-combo-spewer-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar <AMOUNT>`
